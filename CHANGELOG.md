## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Session root existence check on recipe calls (K-239)**: `recipe_run`, `recipe_list`, and `recipe_list_plugins` now verify that the session root directory still exists before executing. When the root has been removed (e.g. a worktree was deleted while the session was still active), callers receive a clear error — `"session root path no longer exists, please call session_start again: <path>"` — instead of an opaque `just --dump` failure. Call `session_start` with a valid root to recover.
